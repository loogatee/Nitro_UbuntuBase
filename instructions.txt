Build Linux Kernel and Device Tree

   - instructions:   http://boundarydevices.com/cross-compiling-kernels-2014-edition
   - Details are under the heading 'Device Tree'
   - Execute lines 1 thru 8 in this list, where the last line is:
                   'make uImage modules dtbs -j4'


          I followed the directions under heading "Device Tree".
          The directory where I built everything in was /opt.
          So my kernel is under:  /opt/linux-imx6

          You don't need to execute every single instruction in the list.
          Start at the top with:  "git clone ...."
          End with:  "make uImage modules dtbs -j4"

            ~/$ git clone git://github.com/boundarydevices/linux-imx6.git
            ~/$ cd linux-imx6
            ~/linux-imx6$ export ARCH=arm
            ~/linux-imx6$ export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
            ~/linux-imx6$ export LOADADDR=10008000
            ~/linux-imx6$ git checkout boundary-imx_3.10.17_1.0.2_ga
            ##  ~/linux-imx6$ make nitrogen6x_defconfig
            ~/linux-imx6$ make nit6xlite_defconfig
            ~/linux-imx6$ make uImage modules dtbs -j4


   ## - use this config:   nitrogen6xBD_defconfig
   ## - copy to:     /opt/linux-imx6/arch/arm/configs




format an sdcard with 2 partitions

   - the 1st 80% format as ext4
   - the last 20%, format as fat32
   - I used gparted for this
   - once formatted, make sure it's mounted
   - we're only concerned with the ext4 section

cd ~

git clone https://github.com/loogatee/Nitro_UbuntuBase.git

cd Nitro_UbuntuBase

edit these files:

    install_bdlinux.sh

    rootfs/etc/hostname

    rootfs/etc/resolv.conf

./install_bdlinux.sh

Boot from sdcard, login as root (password: bdat), issue this command:

./1stboot_config.sh

reboot
