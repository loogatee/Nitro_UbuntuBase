Build Linux Kernel and Device Tree

   - instructions:   http://boundarydevices.com/cross-compiling-kernels-2014-edition
   - Details are under the heading 'Device Tree'
   - use this config:   nitrogen6xBD_defconfig
   - copy to:     /opt/linux-imx6/arch/arm/configs
   - Execute lines 1 thru 8 in this list, where the last line is:
                   'make uImage modules dtbs -j4'



format an sdcard with 2 partitions

   - the 1st 80% format as ext4
   - the last 20%, format as fat32
   - I used gparted for this
   - once formatted, make sure it's mounted
   - we're only concerned with the ext4 section

cd ~

bzr checkout bzr+ssh://devbuntu/opt/repository/projects/ApexLinux/UbuntuCore_CustomFiles_BD

cd UbuntuCore_CustomFiles_BD

edit these files:

    install_bdlinux.sh

    rootfs/etc/hostname

    rootfs/etc/resolv.conf

./install_bdlinux.sh

Boot from sdcard, login as root (password: bdat), issue this command:

./1stboot_config.sh

reboot
